# Get-Next-Line
ðŸ’Ÿ What is the goal?
The goal is to read one line at a time from a file or standard input (stdin). In this project I will learn file manipulation, dynamic memory management and optimization.

**Typical challenges**:
- Ensure that the function is efficient and does not read more data than necessary.
- Avoid memory leaks (use `free` correctly).
- Keep the logic clear, even with the use of several helper functions.
